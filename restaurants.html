			<h2>Mr. Ming’s Chinese <br/> Dining, Hong Kong</h2>
			<p>Mr. Ming's signature dishes come from his grandfather's book of Chiu Chow and Cantonese

                Some must-try dishes include Steamed Whole Crab with Pork Patty and Conpoy, 
                Soyed French Foie Gras with Egg, and Smoked Duck with Bagasse in Chiu Chow Style. 
                Along with their signature dishes, they also serve handcrafted Dim Sum made fresh daily. 
                Specialties include Ming's Signature Steamed Shrimp Dumplings, Braised Pork Belly 
                Buns with Preserved Vegetables, and Deep-Fried Abalone Pastries.</p>
