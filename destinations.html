			<h2>Infinity Pool, Singapore</h2>
			<p>This pool is located at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. It is the world's longest and most elevated pool. The 
                pool sits on three 55-story tall hotel towers, and it's only available to hotel guests. Also, although the pool's 
                vanishing edge appears dangerous, it is safe due to a trough-like basin located just below the top edge that 
                catches and returns water that flows over the edge.</p>

			<h2>Grand Prismatic Hot <br/> Spring, Wyoming</h2>
			<p>This natural pool is located in Yellowstone National Park. It is the largest hot spring in the United States 
                and the third-largest in the world. This spring is 370 feet in diameter, and the water comes from a crack 
                in the Earth that is 121 feet deep. It gets its rainbow colors from different species of heating-loving 
                bacteria surrounding the cooler areas of the spring.</p>

			<h2>Marble Caves, Chile</h2>
			<p>This cave is located in the General Carrera Lake of Chile Chico, Ays√©n, Chile. The main marble caves are 
                accessible from Puerto Tranquilo by kayak or boat. Marble deposits from over 6,200 years ago have been worn away 
                by the water, creating the caves and tunnels seen today. Beneath the arches, the water appears luminescent 
                turquoise from the glacial meltwater. </p>
